## Inference Control Fundamentals

### Definition & Purpose
**Inference Control** = The practice of preventing unauthorized derivation of sensitive information from seemingly non-sensitive data or queries

### The Privacy-Utility Trade-off
```
Raw Data → Processing/Anonymization → Released Data
    ↓              ↓                       ↓
  Sensitive    Privacy Controls      Useful but Safe
```

### Core Challenge
How to make information available for legitimate purposes (research, statistics) while protecting individual privacy and sensitive data from unauthorized inference.

### Research Context Example
Medical records are private but extremely valuable for research purposes. The challenge is enabling researchers to access meaningful data patterns without compromising patient privacy or revealing specific individual information.

---

## Statistical Database Security

### The Inference Problem

#### **Basic Inference Attack Example:**
```
Query 1: "What is the average salary of female CS professors at SJSU?"
Answer: €95,000

Query 2: "How many female CS professors at SJSU?"
Answer: 1

Result: Specific salary information leaked through general queries!
```

#### **Why This Happens:**
- Small result sets make individuals identifiable
- Combining multiple queries reveals sensitive details
- Statistical aggregates can expose individual records

### Naive Inference Control Approaches

#### **1. Remove Direct Identifiers**
- **Approach**: Remove names, IDs, obvious identifiers
- **Problem**: Still vulnerable to quasi-identifier attacks
- **Reality**: Removing names alone is insufficient

#### **2. Simple Query Restrictions**
- **Approach**: Block certain types of queries
- **Problem**: Overly restrictive, reduces data utility
- **Reality**: Often breaks legitimate research needs

---

## Advanced Inference Control Techniques

### Query Set Size Control

#### **Minimum Threshold Approach:**
- Don't return answers if result set size is too small
- Prevents attacks on individual records
- Trade-off between privacy and query utility

#### **N-respondent, k% Dominance Rule:**
- Do not release statistics if k% or more is contributed by N or fewer individuals
- **Example**: Don't release average salary in Bill Gates' neighborhood
- Used by organizations like the US Census Bureau

### Randomization Techniques

#### **Controlled Noise Addition:**
- Add small amounts of random noise to data
- Preserves statistical properties while obscuring individuals
- **Challenge**: Balancing noise level vs. data utility

#### **Differential Privacy:**
- Mathematical framework for privacy protection
- Provides formal guarantees about privacy loss
- Adds calibrated noise based on query sensitivity

---

## K-Anonymity Privacy Model

### Definition and Core Concept

#### **K-anonymity Requirement:**
A dataset satisfies k-anonymity if every record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes.

#### **Quasi-identifiers:**
- Attributes that can be linked with external data to re-identify individuals
- Examples: Age, Gender, ZIP code, Race
- Key insight: Even non-unique attributes become identifying in combination

### K-anonymity Implementation

#### **Generalization Techniques:**
- **Suppression**: Remove specific values
- **Generalization**: Replace specific values with broader categories
  - "25 years old" → "20-30 years old"
  - "02139" → "021**"
  - "Black" → "Person"

#### **Example Transformation:**
```
Original Data:
[Asian, 02138] → [Person, 02138]
[Black, 02139] → [Person, 02139]
[White, 02141] → [Person, 02141]
```

### Attacks Against K-anonymity

#### **1. Unsorted Matching Attack:**
- **Problem**: Tuple ordering can leak information
- **Solution**: Randomly sort released data
- **Cause**: Relational model assumption violated in practice

#### **2. Complementary Release Attack:**
- **Problem**: Multiple releases can be linked to reveal information
- **Example**: Linking tables on different attributes reveals unique records
- **Solution**: Consider previous releases when creating new ones

#### **3. Temporal Attack:**
- **Problem**: Data changes over time, new releases may compromise old ones
- **Solution**: Base new releases on previous anonymized versions
- **Challenge**: Dynamic datasets require continuous protection

## CAPTCHA - Human Interactive Proofs

### Definition & Purpose
**CAPTCHA** = Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart

Also known as **HIP** (Human Interactive Proof)

### The CAPTCHA Paradox
*"CAPTCHA is a program that can generate and grade tests that it itself cannot pass... much like some professors..."*

This paradox highlights the core principle: a computer system creates and evaluates challenges that computers (ideally) cannot solve, but humans can.

### Design Principles - Rules of the Game

#### **Core Requirements:**
1. **Easy for most humans to pass** - High human success rate
2. **Difficult or impossible for machines** - Low computer success rate
3. **Public algorithm** - Security through randomness, not secrecy
4. **Automated generation and grading** - Scalable without human intervention

#### **Kerckhoffs' Principle Applied:**
- From attacker's perspective, only unknown should be random number
- Algorithm and general approach should be publicly known
- Security comes from computational difficulty, not secrecy

#### **Accessibility Considerations:**
- Multiple CAPTCHA types needed for different abilities
- Visual CAPTCHAs exclude blind users
- Audio CAPTCHAs help visually impaired users
- Consider motor disabilities in interaction design

## CAPTCHA Types and Implementation

### Visual CAPTCHAs

#### **Text-based Challenges:**
- **Approach**: Distorted text recognition
- **Example**: "Find 2 words in the following" with warped text
- **Technical basis**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) difficulty
- **Key challenge**: Segmentation problem - separating characters

#### **Image-based Challenges:**
- **Approach**: Object recognition in images
- **Examples**: "Select all images with cars", "Click on traffic lights"
- **Advantages**: More intuitive for users
- **Challenges**: Machine learning advances threaten effectiveness

### Audio CAPTCHAs

#### **Distorted Speech:**
- **Approach**: Speech recognition with noise/distortion
- **Benefit**: Accessible to visually impaired users
- **Challenge**: Background noise, multiple speakers
- **Human advantage**: Better at parsing speech in noise

#### **Musical Patterns:**
- **Approach**: Pattern recognition in audio
- **Example**: "How many different instruments do you hear?"
- **Advantage**: Harder for machines to process

### Current Limitations
- **No effective text-based CAPTCHAs exist**
- **Possible theoretical impossibility** for pure text challenges
- **Evolution towards behavioral analysis** and context-based verification
