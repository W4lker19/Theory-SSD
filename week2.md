## Biometric Authentication Fundamentals

### Definition & Purpose
**Biometric Authentication** = Automated verification of identity based on measurable physiological or behavioral characteristics

### Core Principles
```
Biometric Authentication = Measurement → Feature Extraction → Template Matching
                              ↓                ↓                    ↓
                         Capture sample   Create template    Compare & decide
```

### Two-Phase Biometric Process

#### **Phase 1: Enrollment**
- User provides biometric sample(s)
- System extracts features and creates template
- Template stored in database with user identity
- Quality control ensures acceptable registration

#### **Phase 2: Recognition**
- User provides fresh biometric sample
- System extracts features from sample
- Features compared against stored template(s)
- Accept/reject decision based on similarity score

### Biometric System Properties
- **Universality**: Everyone should possess the characteristic
- **Distinctiveness**: Characteristic should vary across individuals
- **Permanence**: Characteristic should be stable over time
- **Collectability**: Characteristic can be measured quantitatively

## Biometric Performance Metrics

### Error Rate Analysis

#### **Primary Error Types:**
- **False Accept Rate (FAR)**: Probability system incorrectly accepts unauthorized user
- **False Reject Rate (FRR)**: Probability system incorrectly rejects authorized user
- **Equal Error Rate (EER)**: Point where FAR = FRR (comparison metric)
- **Failure to Enroll (FTE)**: Percentage of users who cannot register

#### **Operational Metrics:**
- **False Match Rate (FMR)**: Template-level false acceptance
- **False Non-Match Rate (FNMR)**: Template-level false rejection

- **Transaction success rate**: Percentage of successful authentications

#### **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC):**
```
Security ←→ Usability Trade-off
High Threshold: Low FAR, High FRR (More Secure, Less Usable)
Low Threshold:  High FAR, Low FRR (Less Secure, More Usable)
```
