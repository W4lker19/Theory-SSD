## Virus Fundamentals

### Virus Definition & Structure
**Computer Virus** = Self-replicating program that attaches to other programs and executes when the host program runs

#### **Core Components:**
- **Infection Mechanism**: Enables replication and attachment
- **Trigger**: Event that activates the payload
- **Payload**: The actual malicious or benign activity

#### **Virus Structure Code Example:**
```
program V :=
{goto main;
 1234567;

 subroutine infect-executable :=
 {loop:
  file := get-random-executable-file;
  if (first-line-of-file = 1234567)
   then goto loop
   else prepend V to file; }

 subroutine do-damage :=
 {whatever damage is to be done}

 subroutine trigger-pulled :=
 {return true if some condition holds}

main: main-program :=
 {infect-executable;
  if trigger-pulled then do-damage;
  goto next;}

next:
}
```

### Virus Life Cycle Phases

#### **1. Dormant Phase**
- Virus exists but is not actively spreading
- Waiting for specific trigger conditions
- May remain dormant for extended periods

#### **2. Propagation Phase**
- Virus replicates itself to other programs or systems
- Searches for new hosts to infect
- Implements infection mechanisms

#### **3. Triggering Phase**
- Specific condition activates the virus
- Triggers can be dates, events, or system states
- Determines when payload executes

#### **4. Execution Phase**
- Virus performs its intended malicious activity
- May cause damage, steal data, or provide access
- Effects can range from benign to destructive

### Virus Classification

#### **By Target:**
- **File infectors**: Attach to executable files
- **Boot sector viruses**: Infect boot records
- **Macro viruses**: Target document macros
- **Script viruses**: Use scripting languages

#### **By Infection Method:**
- **Prepended**: Virus code added to beginning
- **Postpended**: Virus code added to end
- **Embedded**: Virus code inserted within program
- **Overwriting**: Replaces original code

#### **By Stealth Level:**
- **Simple**: Easily detectable by signatures

- **Polymorphic**: Code changes appearance each infection
- **Metamorphic**: Entire structure mutates
